WHEN WOULD YOU WANT TO USE A REMOTE REPOSITORY RATHER THAN KEEPING ALL WORK LOCAL?

If others will be working on the repository, or if I want to simply share it with the public.


********************
WHY MIGHT YOU WANT TO ALWAYS PULL CHANGES MANUALLY RATHER THAN HAVING GIT AUTOMATICALLY STAY UP-TO-DATE WITH YOUR REMOTE REPOSITORY?

To prevent suprise changes in the midst of working on a modification.


********************
DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FORKS, CLONES, AND BRANCHES.  WHEN WOULD YOU USE ONE INSTEAD OF ANOTHER?

A clone is a copy of a repository.  The clone function is used primarily to copy a remote repository on to a local machine, or local machine to another local machine.

A fork is basically a clone.  The difference with a fork is that it clones repositories soley on the GitHub website.  Fork is typically used to clone a repository from someone elses GitHub account to their own GitHub account.  A fork is only possible on the GitHub website.  For example, if a user wishes to contribute and make changes to a repository found on GitHub, this may not be allowed.  In this case a fork can be used to duplicate the repository into their own account, and then changes can be made to the copy without affecting the original repository.

A Branch is a label which is placed on the most recent commit, or series of commits.  It represents the tip of the series back to its first ancestor.  The series is traced by following each parent.
A Branch is used to denote a series of edits with a common goal or feature.

For example:
A word processor application could be under development.  The branch labeled "Master" represents all the commits (steps, edits, modifications) aimed at the goal of completing the "Word Processor Program".  Branching off the Main branch could be an "Email Feature".  The email feature will still work with the word processor program, but the branch will be focused on developing the email feature.  Hence, the branch named "Email Feature" represents all the commits(steps, edits, modifications) aimed at the goal of completing the "Email Feature".


********************
WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A COPY OF THE LAST KNOWN STATE OF THE REMOTE STORED LOCALLY?

Conflicts can be examined before merging branches.  Also, if no internet access is available, the stored copy would reflect accurately to the remote repository as of the last pull.


********************
HOW WOULD YOU COLLABORATE WITHOUT USING GIT OR GITHUB?  WHAT WOULD BE EASIER, AND WHAT WOULD BE HARDER?

Now that I have been exposed to professional version control, I would probably seek out another high level version control system, if I wasn't able to use Git.  In the past, I would have used my own crude system of version control, patching it together with email, maybe google docs, and who knows what else.

Because I am so impressed by Git and GitHub, and how well it addresses the specific needs of programmers, and the development of projects, I would venture to say that any other system would be a more difficult solution overall.


********************
WHEN WOULD YOU WANT TO MAKE CHANGES IN A SEPARATE BRANCH RATHER THAN DIRECTLY IN MASTER?  WHAT BENEFITS DOES EACH APPROACH HAVE?

Because of the added overhead of branching out, in a collaborative environment, I would tend to be very selective on what I choose to branch out on.  Attempting to come up with guidelines as to what would warrant a branch and what would not, seems rather difficult at this time.
Enjoying the freedom benefits of branching, but yet considering the additional work involved, puts me in a bittersweet situation.

Without overthinking it too much, I would probably start off with a basic rule:  If changes are few and small, with little risk of breaking the master; then work directly on the master.  Otherwise, create a branch.

In actuality, as with other disciplines in my life, experience has shown to be the most definitive teacher.  With that, I believe working with GitHub in a collaborative environment, over time, would surely give me the best information on which to base my tailor made criteria for when, and when not to branch.

But the question still remains in my mind: What about the etiquette/policy of collaboration?  I think I may be missing a piece of the puzzle here.  How can one make changes directly on the master, push them up to GitHub, and not defeat the review process of collaboration?

I would definitely want to inquire on the methods used by those who have experience with GitHub.

This was probalby the most difficult question for me in this course.
